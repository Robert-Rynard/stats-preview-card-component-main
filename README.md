## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to practice mobile-first implementation as well as working with background images and making sure they are responsive.

### Continued development

I struggled with getting the background image to be responsive on all screen sizes. Going forward I would like to better understand how background images work and better be able to manipulate them to fit the design.
